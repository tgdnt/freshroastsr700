* FreshRoastSR700

This is a fork of [[https://github.com/roastero/freshroastsr700][freshroastsr700]] with a modification originally
shared by [[https://github.com/trankin][trankin]] [[https://github.com/trankin/Openroast/releases/tag/v1.2.1.1][here]].

This library can regulate the temperature during your roast by
cycling the heat setting between /high/ and /low/. Some
FreshRoast SR700 units don't understand the /low/ setting and so
end up staying on high all the time, burning your coffee.

With this change, it will instead cycle between /high/ and
/cool/ and successfully regulate temperature, even with our
special FreshRoast SR700 units.

See my [[https://github.com/tgdnt/openroast][fork]] of openroast with the requirements.txt file you need
to install freshroastsr700 from this repo instead of PyPI.

See [[https://github.com/roastero/freshroastsr700][upstream repo]] for more information about freshroastsr700.
